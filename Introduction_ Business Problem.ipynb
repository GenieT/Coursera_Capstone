I am also particularly interested in **areas with no cafes in vicinity**. I would also prefer locations **as close to city center as possible**, assuming that first two conditions are met.\n\nI will use my data science powers to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3.5", "name": "python3", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"mimetype": "text/x-python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "version": "3.5.5", "name": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "file_extension": ".py", "codemirror_mode": {"version": 3, "name": "ipython"}}}, "nbformat": 4}
